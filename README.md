# 🫁 Lung Nodule Segmentation on LIDC-IDRI Dataset

This project focuses on segmenting lung nodules from CT scan images using deep learning techniques, specifically a UNet-based architecture.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Developed a UNet-based deep learning model tailored for lung nodule segmentation using the publicly available **LIDC-IDRI** dataset. The model integrates separable convolutions, resulting in approximately **35% reduced model complexity** while maintaining a **DICE score of 89%**.
